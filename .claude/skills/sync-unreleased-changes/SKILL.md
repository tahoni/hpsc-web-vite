description: Ensure every notable change on the current branch is reflected in CHANGELOG.md's [Unreleased] section, filling in anything missing, and consolidate duplicate sub-headers so related entries stay grouped together. Use whenever the user asks to sync/audit the CHANGELOG's Unreleased section, or as a prerequisite before drafting a release.

# Sync Unreleased Changes

An optional base branch override may be passed as `args` (defaults to `develop`; use `main` instead when the current
branch is a `hotfix/*` branch, per AGENTS.md's Git Workflow).

## 🔍 Gather current state

Before drafting, run these yourself and read their output:

1. `git branch --show-current`
2. `git branch --list develop main` (base branch candidates)
3. Determine the merge base: `git merge-base HEAD <base>` where `<base>` is `args` if supplied, falling back to
   `develop`, then `main`
4. `git --no-pager log --oneline <merge-base>..HEAD` (commits on this branch not yet on the base branch)
5. `git --no-pager diff <merge-base>..HEAD` (full diff of this branch against its base)
6. `git status --short` (working tree status — uncommitted changes, if any)
7. `git --no-pager diff HEAD` (uncommitted diff, staged and unstaged, if any)
8. Read `CHANGELOG.md` in full, focusing on the current `### 🧪 [Unreleased]` section.
9. Read `AGENTS.md` in full for conventions.

## 🚀 Instructions

Read and strictly follow the **Documentation Conventions** and **Git Workflow** sections in AGENTS.md (loaded above),
plus its **Build & Run Commands** and **Architecture Overview** sections for accurate technical detail when describing
what changed. Treat it as the single source of truth.

1. **Determine the branch's full change set.** Combine the committed diff (branch vs. base) and any uncommitted
   working-tree diff above — together these are every change this branch introduces. Ignore merge commits' own diffs;
   look at the actual content changes.
2. **Read the existing `### 🧪 [Unreleased]` section** of CHANGELOG.md (loaded above) and build a mental list of what
   it already documents.
3. **Cross-check every notable change against that list.** A change is "notable" per Keep a Changelog norms —
   new/changed/fixed/deprecated/removed behaviour, public API, schema, config or documentation structure. Skip purely
   mechanical noise (formatting-only diffs, generated file churn) unless AGENTS.md calls it out specifically (e.g.
   dependency security overrides *are* notable).
4. **For each notable change not already covered**, draft a CHANGELOG entry:
    - Place it under the matching standard subheading (`#### ➕ Added`, `#### 🔄 Changed`, `#### 🐛 Fixed`,
      `#### ⚠️ Deprecated`, `#### 🗑️ Removed`, `#### 🔐 Security`) — create the subheading if the file's `[Unreleased]`
      section is missing it, in that category order.
    - Group it under the right `##### <Area>` sub-header (matching existing area names already used in the file where
      one fits, e.g. `Components`, `Styling`, `Build & Tooling`, `Dependencies`, `Documentation`; introduce a new one
      only if nothing existing fits).
    - Follow the established bullet style: a plain, factual description of what changed and why, with backticked
      identifiers (component, file, constant, class) — not a bold-lead-in label.
    - British English spelling and grammar throughout.
5. **For each change already covered**, verify the existing entry is still accurate against the actual diff (right
   file/class named, description still matches what the code does); flag any that have drifted, but don't rewrite
   entries that are still correct just to change their wording.
6. **Do not remove or alter entries** for changes unrelated to this branch's diff — this skill only adds/corrects
   coverage for what this branch actually introduced.
7. **Consolidate duplicate sub-headers across the whole `[Unreleased]` section**, not just newly added entries — this
   catches drift left by earlier runs or by commits that each added their own `##### <Area>` block. Within each
   `#### <Category>` section (`Added`/`Changed`/`Fixed`/`Deprecated`/`Removed`/`Security`), if the same
   `##### <Area>` heading appears more than once, merge every occurrence into a single block at the position of its
   first occurrence; concatenate the bullets in their original relative order, then delete the now-empty duplicate
   heading(s). Don't reorder, reword or deduplicate the surviving bullets themselves, and don't merge headings that
   are only similarly named (e.g. `Components` and `Layouts` stay separate unless the file already treats them as the
   same area).
8. **Apply the edits directly to `CHANGELOG.md`** using Edit — new bullets under their correct subheading/area (creating
   empty category headings only if genuinely needed, matching the file's existing heading order), plus the sub-header
   consolidation from step 7; do not leave the fix as a suggestion. Do not touch the Table of Contents or any released
   version section.

## 📤 Output

After editing CHANGELOG.md, report concisely:

1. **Coverage check summary** — how many notable changes were found on the branch, how many were already documented, how
   many were newly added.
2. **What was added**, as a fenced `markdown` diff-style list of the new bullets (or "Nothing to add — `[Unreleased]`
   already covers every notable change on this branch.").
3. **Any entries flagged as drifted** (inaccurate against the current diff) that need manual review, with a one-line
   reason each — do not silently rewrite these; call them out for the user to confirm.
4. **Any sub-headers consolidated**, e.g. "Merged two `##### Components` blocks under `#### 🔄 Changed` into one" (or
   "No duplicate sub-headers found.").
